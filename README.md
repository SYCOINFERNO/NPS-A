## Introduction

Cisco Packet Tracer is a powerful network simulation tool that allows users to create network topologies and simulate network behavior. This repository aims to provide a collection of experiments that cover different networking topics, including DHCP, DNS, and various networking devices.

## Prerequisites

To use the experiments in this repository, you will need:

- **Cisco Packet Tracer**: Download and install the latest version of Cisco Packet Tracer from the [Cisco Networking Academy](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer).
- **Basic Networking Knowledge**: Familiarity with basic networking concepts and protocols.

## Experiments

This repository includes the following experiments:

1. **DHCP Configuration**
   - Setting up a DHCP server to automatically assign IP addresses to clients.

2. **DNS Server Configuration**
   - Implementing a DNS server for hostname resolution within a network.

3. **Hub Configuration**
   - Creating a simple network using a hub and understanding its limitations.

4. **Router Configuration**
   - Configuring routers for inter-network communication and routing protocols.

5. **Router Practice**
   - Hands-on exercises for configuring various router settings and features.

6. **Switch Configuration**
   - Setting up switches, including VLANs and trunking.

7. **Server Configuration**
   - Deploying different types of servers (e.g., web server, file server) and configuring their settings.

## Usage

To run any of the experiments:

1. Download the corresponding `.pkt` file from this repository.
2. Open the file in Cisco Packet Tracer.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the experiment's README file.
